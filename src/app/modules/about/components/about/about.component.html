    <p>
      I began working on my Software Engineering degree at Utah Valley
      University in 2018. In 2020, I joined Savory Restaurant Fund as a
      developer. I have had the opportunity to work on many projects that have
      helped make life easier for employees and customers alike.

        [level]="skill.level"
      ></app-skill>
